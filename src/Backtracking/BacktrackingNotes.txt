Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique that tries all possible solutions step-by-step and undoes (backtracks)
when a choice leads to an invalid solution.

Types of backtracking problems:
1. Enumeration Problems
2. Optimization Problems
3. Decision Problems

Key components of backtracking:
1. Choice: At each step, you have a set of choices to make.
2. Constraints: Conditions that must be satisfied for a solution to be valid.
3. Goal: The desired outcome or solution you are trying to achieve.

Steps to implement backtracking:
1. Define a recursive function that takes the current state and the choices made so far.
2. Check if the current state is a valid solution. If it is, add it to the list of solutions.
3. If the current state is not valid, return and backtrack to the previous state.
4. For each choice available at the current state, make the choice and recursively call the function with the updated state.
5. After exploring that choice, undo the choice (backtrack) and try the next available choice.
